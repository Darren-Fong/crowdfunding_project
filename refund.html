            <h2>Conditions for Returns</h2>
            <p>In order for the Goods to be eligible for a return, please make sure that:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
                <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
                <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
                <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.</li>

            <h2>Returning Goods</h2>

            <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>

            <h2>Gifts</h2>
            <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
            <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
